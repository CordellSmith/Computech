					<h3>About CompuTech</h3>
				<p>
					CompuTech was founded by John Smithers in 2009. In John's early 30's he had a dream to start a computer business that can provide a quality of service to its customers unlike any other tech business. His dream was spearheaded in 2012 by a small team who also shared his vision in the local suburb of Fremantle, Perth WA. It didn't take long for the business to grow as positive word spread like wildfire about the quality of service that was brought to its customers. This flourish of business attracted the attention of major technology brands who backed the business, funding a major expansion to a national level. CompuTech is now located in every state in Australia with its largest retailers based out of Perth, Melbourne and Sydney.
